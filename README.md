Follow these steps to **clone and run locally**:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

cd ChatBuddy-AI

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

If you’re using Node.js backend (Render deployment):

npm install
```

*(If you use the Vercel setup with `/api`, you don’t need Express)*

### 3️⃣ Set your Gemini API Key

In `server.js` (or `api/ask.js`), replace:

```javascript
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

with your Gemini API Key.

*(You can get it from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/))*

### 4️⃣ Start the server

```

Open your browser at:

```

```
